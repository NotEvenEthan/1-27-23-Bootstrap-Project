                <h1 class="typing-demo">From the Man Who Sold the World</h1>
                <p class="read">This website is dedicated to sharing music from the Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain soundtrack. They relate to the game's theme and just sound good in general. The Man Who Sold The World covered by Midge Ure is the game's main story-related song as it reveals the twist that the protagonist you're playing is not who you think he is. There is also meaning in choosing the Midge Ure cover rather than using the original song by David Bowie.

                  <h2>Who Will Save The World</h2>
                  
                  <p>The game is set during the Soviet-Afghan War and takes place in Africa as well. As a private military not loyal to a nation, the protagonist fights againt both the Soviets, CIA, and other private military corporations. Because of this, there are depictions of the use of chemicals and child soldiers, showcasing the horrors of war. This song reflects that similar to how songs like Creedence Clearwater Revival's <em>Fortunate Son</em> reflect the Vietnam War.</p>

                  <h2>Rebel Yell</h2>
                  <p>This song is more for being fun similar to how <em>Flight of the Valkries</em> is used in the film <em>Apocolypse Now</em>. It's just fun and makes whatever action the player is doing fun. Personally, I use it as my helicopter music so whenever I call for an exfil or air support, Rebel Yell plays.

                  <h2>Dancing With Tears In My Eyes</h2>
                  
                  <p>This is a pretty sad song in the game. In one of the missions, you are forced to kill off some of your men because they risk spreading an uncurable and deadly virus across the world. The virus works like the way parasites take over snails, taking over their brain and forcing them to be eaten by birds in order to be spread again.</p>

                  <h2>Diamond Dogs</h2>
                  <p>This isn't a song, but does relate back to The Man Who Sold The World. In the game, the Diamond Dogs are a private military force led by the protagonist, slowing growing in power as the game progresses. In relation to the song, this time by David Bowie and not the cover, Diamond Dogs is an album by David Bowie with aspects based on George Orwell's <em>1984</em>.
